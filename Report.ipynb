    "Restaurants are one of the most profitable sectors. However, according to one study, 60 percent close or change owners within the first year of operation, 80 percent fail within five years. Usually, restaurants fail with combination of problems that eventually lead to their closure. A bad location is one of the biggest reasons for restaurant failure. For example, a restaurant can sell the best \"burger\" in the world. If it is in a poor location (hidden, sparsely inhabited, blind and difficult to access) it will have to put in much more effort to fetch customers than to serve them.\n",
